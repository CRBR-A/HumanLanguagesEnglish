# Speaking and Listening : Agree or Disagree?
## Fast Food and the Environment

Do you agree or disagree with these statements? Say why. Ask your partner or small group:

1. "Why should I separate my rubbish at a fast food restaurant? I don't want to feel like a member of staff. That's their job! They should do it. I paid for my food."
2. "You should never take more than you give." - Tim Rice ('Circle of Life')
3. "When the last tree has been cut down, the last fish caught, the last river **poisoned**, only then will we realise that one cannot eat money." - Native American **saying**.
