## Fast Food and the Environment

Do you agree or disagree with these statements? Say why. Ask your partner or small group:

1. “Why should I separate my rubbish at a fast food restaurant? I don’t want to feel like a member of staff. That’s their job! They should do it. I paid for my food.”
2. “You should never take more than you give.” – Tim Rice (‘Circle of Life’)
3. “When the last tree has been cut down, the last fish caught, the last river
poisoned, only then will we realise that one cannot eat money.” – Native American saying.
