1. Have you ever been to Australia? If yes, tell me about it. If no, would you like to? What do you think
of when you hear the word ‘Australia’?
2. Australia is the only country in the world that is also a whole continent! The landscape and climate
are very varied, ranging from tropical in the northeast, to desert in the centre, and urban / beach at the
coastal resorts. Tell me about the landscape and climate in your country. How does it compare?
3. Australia has some of the strangest animals in the world! Because of its island location, it was a
closed ecosystem for millennia, and many exotic creatures developed there which are unique to
Australia, such as the duck-billed platypus. Tell me about the weird and wonderful wildlife in your
country.

and Russell Crowe, and sports stars, such as Shane Warne. Tell me about famous people from your
country.

which means to go travelling for an extended period of time. Would you give up your education or work
for a year and go travelling? Why? / Why not? Where would you like to visit? How would you kill time?
8. Are you a fan of Australian culture? Have you ever had any problems understanding the Australian
accent? Do you know any Australian slang?
