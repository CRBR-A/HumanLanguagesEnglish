# Discussion Questions for English Classes
## Englishness

Discuss the following questions with a partner or small group:
1. What do you know about English people? Do you know many English people? Do they live up to
your expectations of Englishness? What do you think are the essential characteristics of English
people? Is it even possible to define a whole nation of people with a few characteristics, or do we just
end up with unrepresentative stereotypes?
2. How do English people differ from people in your country? What differences can you list –
both positive and negative? Have you ever been to England? If yes, what differences did you notice?
How did you feel living there? Did you find it easy or difficult to get used to English people? Why?
If no, would you like to visit England – or live there temporarily or permanently? Why? / Why not?
3. Do you have a good sense of humour? Do you think that the English deserve their great reputation
for humour? Which English comedy shows / films / comedians / books, etc. do you find funny?
What do you like about them? Is there anything about them that makes them typically English?
4. What is your experience of English food and drink? Do you like it? Why? / Why not? How does it
compare to food from your country? What English food and drink brands are available to buy where
you live? Do you ever buy them?
5. What examples of Englishness do you see in the media that you have access to, e.g. music, films,
TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, websites, etc.? Which people best define what you think of as
Englishness?
6. Would you like to be English? Why? / Why not? What do you think would be the advantages and
disadvantages? Would there be more positive points than negative ones? What problems can you
imagine encountering that you don’t normally have in your culture?
7. Are you easily embarrassed? What is the most embarrassing thing that you have ever done?
What happened? Why was it embarrassing? How do you usually avoid embarrassing situations?
How successful are you? Why do you think English people feel embarrassed so often?
8. Are you a straight-talker? Do you say what you mean and mean what you say? What about the
English people that you know? Could your friends possibly describe you as two-faced? What would
happen if one day all English people suddenly began speaking directly and acting in a confident
manner?
