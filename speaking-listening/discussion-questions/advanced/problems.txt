# Discussion Questions for English Classes
## Problems

Discuss the following questions with a partner or small group:
1. What is the biggest problem you have faced so far in your life? How did you deal with it? Who helped
you? If you had the same problem again, would you tackle it in the same way? Has it helped you
become stronger? How?
2. Who do you usually go to for advice when you don’t know what to do? Have you ever had
counselling or therapy? Is it easier to trust a stranger than somebody close to you? Would you ever
write in to a magazine for advice?
3. Tell me about a problem that you’ve got at the moment. What caused it? How serious is it on a scale
of 1 (not serious) to 10 (very serious)? How are you planning to handle it? Who will be the best person
to lend a hand?
4. Given the choice, would you rather have ten niggling problems or one big problem? Why?
5. When did you last help somebody with their problems? What was the problem? What did you
propose as a solution? What was the outcome? Would you recommend the same course of action
if it happened again?
6. Talk about troubles that your family and friends are facing at the moment. What are they and how
are they coping? Are you part of the answer?
7. Are you a caring person? Would you consider training to become a counsellor, and helping people
for a living? Why? / Why not?
8. What social problems do you notice each day? What impact do they have upon your life?
Is education the key to reducing problems in society? Why? / Why not? What programmes should
be run to teach people how to make more informed choices about their lives? Do most people bring
their problems upon themselves? What steps can be taken to prevent problems occurring in the
first place? What other ways are there to tackle social ills?
