1. Translation
- Translate items into the Clear Alphabet, e.g. one page or one column.
- Translate items into your first language, e.g. one page or one column.
- Print one page: how many words/phrases do you know? / not know? Translate them into your first language and learn them.

2. Word Focus
- Do any Discussion Word activities from Talk a Lot Elementary Books 1-3 or Intermediate Book 1 with a given group of words from the dictionary (or your own choice of words). Or you could base a complete You Are The Course Book Mode 1 process on your word list.
- Guess which Talk a Lot unit a word of phrase comes from, e.g. “learner driver” comes from “Unit 6: Cars” from Talk a Lot Elementary Book 2; or identify words that you think are not discussion words in any of the Talk a Lot books, e.g. “why” is not, because it’s a function word rather than a noun, and similarly “busy” is not a discussion word, because it’s an adjective.
- Look for homographs – two words which have the same spelling but different meanings, e.g. park (verb or noun), live (verb or adjective), rose (verb or noun), and import (verb or noun). For more examples of homographs see p.228.
