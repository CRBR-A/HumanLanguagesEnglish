1. Word Focus
- The whole list makes a useful vocabulary list for all students to learn, from beginner level upwards.
- Record an audio (or video) version of a group of items, with a clear reading of each word and phrase.
- Use the dictionary to make list(s) of high-frequency words (e.g. the ten most common words in English) or words that you use a lot; list words that you know but seldom or never use, and resolve to try to use them more often; list words that are new for you and learn them â€“ both
spelling and sounds.
- Choose a group of x words, or half a page, or two pages and write beside each word or phrase what kind of word it is, e.g. noun, verb, adjective, etc.
| brought | verb      |
| brown   | adjective |
| browse  | verb      |
| browser | noun      |
...and so on. Put the same kinds of words into groups (word classes), e.g. you could list x
different colours, or past participles.

2. Sound Focus
- Compare the normal spelling with the phonetic spelling. Sound out each sound in the word.
- Look for words that rhyme, e.g. power, hour, flower, etc. For more on Rhyming Words
- Study spelling and sounds further with any of the special topics in this book.

3. Translation
- Make a sentence using words picked randomly from the dictionary, e.g.
boxing carrot popstar allergy
The popstar always had an allergy to carrots after boxing.
...then translate it into the Clear Alphabet:
th Po pstar Ror lwei Zha d Na l jii t Ka r_ sar ft Bo ksing.
...or use consecutive words in the dictionary which may or may not be related, e.g.
referee refund refuse refute
The referee refuted the argument of the sales assistant who had refused him a refund.
...which translates into the Clear Alphabet as follows:
th re f Ree r Fyoo t_ thii Yar gy mn t vth Seil z si stn_ too w tr Fyoo sti m Ree fund.
