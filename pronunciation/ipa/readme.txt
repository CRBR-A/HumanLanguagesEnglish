several hundred words pronounced differently because of their part-speech have been distinguished. For example,the entries:
    close/v kl/oU/z  and  close/aj kl/oU/s (terminal sibilant varies)
or
    effect/n '/I/,f/E/kt  and  effect/v ,/I/'f/E/kt (stress varies)
distinguish those two parts of speech. Any word with this information will terminate with the virgule (slash) in the vocabulary field, followed by one ormore of the following part-of-speech abbreviations:n, v, av, aj, interj, followed by the rest of the pronunciation record.
