## Notes on the Intermediate Syllabus

### Idioms and Phrasal Verbs

At Intermediate level and above, one of the major challenges for students is learning numerous English idioms and phrasal verbs. There is a topic on idioms in each of the nine Intermediate syllabus units and a topic on phrasal verbs in five units: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

### Revision

There are six topics which ask you to go back to the material in the Elementary syllabus and do revision. These are important grammar topics that should be covered at all levels. Teachers should adjust the level of this material to the level of their students:
- Unit 2: Problems: Punctuation (Revision)
- Unit 3: Media: Articles (Revision)
- Unit 6: Moving Home: Prepositions (Revision)
- Unit 8: Relationships: 5 Tenses and 5 Forms of the Verb (Revision)
- Unit 9: Future Challenges: Future Forms (Revision)
- Unit 9: Future Challenges: Regular and Irregular Verbs (Revision)

### Pronunciation

Teachers should use the pronunciation topics from the Elementary syllabus to teach pronunciation at a level that is appropriate to their students. The unit topics will be different, while the main topics remain the same:
- Word Stress
- Sentence Stress
- Connected Speech – Stress, Reduce, Merge
There are also many other important pronunciation topics from the Elementary syllabus that teachers could focus on and develop at Intermediate level and above, including
- The Schwa Sound
- Glottal Stops
- Weak Forms
- Suffixes
New to the Intermediate syllabus is the opportunity to study the Hard Words pronunciation programme over the course of the syllabus – in eight lessons and one review lesson. This could be easily adapted for Elementary-level students too.
