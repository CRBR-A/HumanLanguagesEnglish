## Syllabi

This is a complete integrated syllabus for teaching and learning English. Teachers can use this syllabus to create an entire 9-month-long course at the level of their choice, using the free material provided.

There are two self-contained syllabi:
- Elementary: CEFR A1 (beginner) to B1 (pre-intermediate)
- Intermediate: CEFR B2 (intermediate) to C2 (proficiency)

Each syllabus is divided into 9 units, with 16 topics under five categories:
- Grammar
- Vocabulary
- Speaking and Listening – Functional English
- Pronunciation
- Writing

Each topic contains links to relevant free teaching material from this website.

We suggest using a syllabus over the course of one school year, covering one unit in each of nine months, with approx. four topics covered per week. Of course, you can set different parameters or simply teach standalone topics, rather than building an entire course.

The Elementary syllabus is organised chronologically, beginning with easier topics, e.g. The English Alphabet, and getting progressively more difficult. For notes on the Intermediate syllabus, please see below.

All the material is free to use and almost all of it is Public Domain. Click here for more details. Most of the material is PDF (opens with Acrobat Reader), with some MP3 files (open with the website player), some PPTX files, a few image files, and some links to videos on YouTube and Facebook.

Some of the material has been added to the website for the first time.

Some of the material is taken from our free books, and is listed with a book code and the relevant page number, e.g. BGB p.24. BGB = Big Grammar Book (see codes below). You will need to download the book and find the right page(s).

Here are a few further general resources that could be useful:

The Elementary syllabus suggests one major writing assignment per month, while the Intermediate syllabus proposes two. Of course you can set more writing tasks – or fewer. It is up to teachers and course managers to organise marked homework and assignments, further study, study skills sessions, and regular tests, e.g. end of unit and end of semester/year tests, either from the material available in the syllabus, or using your own testing procedures and material.

The aim of the Speaking and Listening activities is to practice language functions using techniques and activities from the Speaking and Listening Activities List.

For the writing assignment, there is further help with writing here: Writing Guidance.

When it comes to practicing students' reading skills, we believe that teachers will be able to find many relevant and up-to-date reading resources online or offline, so there are no dedicated reading sections in the syllabi, although there are some reading activities. This also applies to listening texts, although there are a number of audio and video resources included in the syllabus.
